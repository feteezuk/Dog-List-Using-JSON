# Dog-List-Using-JSON

You know that feeling when you do something really simple, but you're really proud of it.

That's how I'm feeling now.

Why?

This is just a simple list using a simple looping Javascript method that is grabbing my code and outputting a list of all the dogs in the JSON object.
